        Chicken spaghetti casserole was made almost exclusively in Mississippi until famed food

        Southern Cooking, published in 1987.

    <p class="introduction">
        With chicken, vegetables, and pasta all held together by a creamy sauce, this casserole is 
        a well-rounded, family-friendly meal. It combines cooked chicken, cooked spaghetti, and 
        sautéed vegetables, plus cream of mushroom soup and shredded cheese. Then everything bakes 
        together to hot and gooey perfection.
