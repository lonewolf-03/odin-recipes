    <h3>Supreme Pizza</h3>

    <p>
        It's a true supreme pizza: bacon, pepperoni slices, red and green bell pepper, red onion, 
        black olives, mozzarella, Parmesan, and basil. Our Test Kitchen calls it an "old-school 
        supreme pizza [like] one would get at Pizza Hut, Shaky's, or a classic pizzeria." The olives 
        and peppers are classic additions that give the pizza a strong nostalgia factor. It's so easy 
        to make at home, and you probably have a few of the ingredients already on hand.

        A Test Kitchen tip: When it comes to jarred pizza sauce, Rao's is the way to go, no question. 
        Another tip from the Test Kitchen: "Using a very high oven temperature is a pro tip to getting
        that pizzeria-style crispiness, rise, and texture from your store-bought dough. A pizza stone 
        ensures a crisp bottom crust. If you don't have one, use a baking sheet turned upside down." 
        Voila! There's dinner, and if you have any leftovers, a deliciously cold breakfast slice just 
        might be in your future.

        When it comes to pizza, you can't go wrong with a variety of toppings. Depending on where you 
        live, supreme may be used to denote a pizza with a smattering of pepperoni, sausage, onions, 
        and peppers, or that list can be amended to include mushrooms, pork, beef, olives, and more.

        Where did the name come from? Well it may have been used for years, but in the late 1970s, 
        Pizza Hut popularized the name when they debuted their Supreme Pizza, topped with pepperoni, 
        seasoned pork, beef, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions.

        <li>2 oz. Canadian bacon slices (about 3 slices), quartered</li>
        <li>1 oz. pepperoni slices (about 15 slices)</li>
        <li>1 small (3 to 4 oz.) red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-in.-thick rounds (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1 small (3 to 4 oz.) green bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1 small (3 to 4 oz.) red onion, cut into 1/4-in.-thick rounds (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/4-oz.) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>6 oz. low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pizza stone or baking sheet on middle rack in oven. Preheat oven to 500°F (do not 
            remove pizza stone while oven preheats). </li>
        <li>Roll dough out into a 14-inch circle on a lightly floured work surface. Transfer dough 
            circle to a piece of parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Spread marinara over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Top with Canadian bacon, pepperoni, 
            red and green bell peppers, red onion, black olives, and mozzarella.  </li>
        <li>Transfer parchment with pizza to hot pizza stone. Bake at 500°F until cheese is bubbly 
            and lightly browned, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove pizza, and let stand 5 minutes; sprinkle with 
            Parmesan and basil. </li>
    </ol>
